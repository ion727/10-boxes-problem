# 10-boxes-problem

The problem goes as follows:
10 boxes are stuck together, and a passageway between them is created. Inside any of the boxes is placed one intelligent coin with the capability to move left and right between the boxes. 

Your objective is the find the coin; to do so you can check check a box, however only one at a time. After you check any box, the coin will either move left or right. 

Considering the worst case scenario, wherein the coin moved in a way to perfectly evade your search for as long as possible, is it possible to devise a search pattern that would guarantee finding the coin in 10 moves or less? If not, how many moves would be required?

This project aims to find all solutions using brute force.
